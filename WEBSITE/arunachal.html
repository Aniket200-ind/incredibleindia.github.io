       <u><h1>Arunachal Pradesh</h1></u>
       <p align="justify">Arunachal Pradesh "the land of dawn-lit mountains") is one of the 29 states of India and is the northeastern-most state of the country. Arunachal Pradesh borders the states of Assam and Nagaland to the south and shares international borders with Bhutan in the west, Myanmar in the east and is separated from China in the north by the McMahon Line. Itanagar is the capital of the state.

A major part of the state is claimed by the Republic of China, and the People's Republic of China referring to it as "South Tibet". During the 1962 Sino-Indian war, Chinese forces temporarily crossed McMahon line, the border line between the state and China.

Land of the Dawn-Lit Mountains is the sobriquet for the state in Sanskrit; it is also known as the Orchid State of India</p>
