	<H1><u><ol>Garud Commando Force</ol></H1></u>

	<p>The Garud Commando Force is the special forces unit of the Indian Air Force. It was formed in September 2004 and has a current strength of approximately 1080 personnel.The unit derives its name from Garuda, a divine bird-like creature of Hindu Mythology.Garud is tasked with the protection of critical Air Force bases and installations; search and rescue during peace and hostilities and disaster relief during calamities.Presently, Garuds are deployed in Congo as part of the UN peace keeping operations.Though Garud is not a "secret" unit, very little is known about its operations and assignments, maybe because National Security Guards and Para Commandos are the primary choice of the Indian government to perform operations. Garuds have been deployed to Congo as a part of the UN peace keeping contingent. They also operate alongside Army special forces in Jammu and Kashmir to gain operational exposure. Towards this purpose, teams from the flights are attached to army SF units. Garud Commandos were tasked to provide security at the Yelahanka AFS during Aero India-2005, 2007, 2011 and 2013.On January 2, 2016, the unit took a casualty during the 2016 Pathankot attack when Commando Gursewak Singh died in action. All the IAF assets were declared safe.<strong><em>[Motto: Defence by Offence]</em></strong></p>
