	<u><h1>Kas Plateau</h1></u>
	<p align="justify">The Kaas Plateau, also known as the Kaas Pathar or Kas Sadas, is a plateau situated 25 kilometres west from Satara city in Maharashtra, India. It falls under the Sahyadri Sub Cluster of the Western Ghats, and it became a part of a UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site in 2012.

It is a biodiversity hotspot known for various types of seasonal wild flowers bloom and numerous species of endemic butterflies annually in the months of August and September.The plateau is situated at an altitude of 1200 metres and is approximately 10 square kilometers in area. Kaas has more than 850 different species of flowering plants.These include orchids, shrubs such as the Karvy, and carnivorous plants such as Drosera Indica. Kaas Pathar is a plateau made from volcanic rocks in the Satara district of Maharashtra, and comes under the biosphere of the Western Ghats. The flora of kaas i.e the entire flowering plants and their related plants are typically restricted to that particular locality only.This is because the plateau is largely formed of basalt which is directly exposed to atmosphere.The basalt is almost covered entirely by a thin cover of soil formed due to erosion and has accumulated a layer of not more than a inch or so.</p>
